# Is the Wikipedia big enough?

Have you ever wondered what is the quickest way of getting from AGH to Moscow. Well, fear not as now you can embark on this epic journey on your own computer. Just let the program randomize two Wikipedia aritcles for You and test your knowlege of interconnections in our world.

## What is it all about?!

Is-the-Wikipedia-big-enough is a desktop game making use of Wikipedia's open data.

## How do I play it?!

Oh it is easy. Just let the game choose two random Wikipedia's articles for You: your origin and your target. While the former will be displayed on the screen, You can look up the latter just by hovering your mouse over it. Your job is to get to the destination through link(s) available in the articles in the lowest amount of steps and under the time limit. 

## Wait, what was that last aritcle about?!

Did You clicked too fast? Just click on the UNDO-MOVE button and go one article back.

## I got lost, what now?!

Just hover your mouse on the red node on the dynamic graph on the left-bottom. It displays the path You have taken during the game allowing You to track your progress. Graph goes down at first but branches to the right if you undo your move and choose another link. 

## What if I land in a remote village in Mongolia?!

That's not a big deal. You can always restart and enjoy a new game. :)
